# Evisort-ApiDownload
Uses the '/documents/{evisortId}/content' endpoint of the Evisort API.  
Downloads PDF's from specific Evisort search queries.  

Input : Excel file exported from Evisort search  
Output : Folder containing all PDFs from that search  

## Todo
* It works. But I forgot that the Evisort Repositories can contain docx too. Need to fix that.
